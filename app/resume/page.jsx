    "Nice to meet you!  My name is Kevin Parker. I am a front-end web designer specializing in React, NodeJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My main focus is landing pages and apps, but I also have plenty of experience in HTMl emails. I have also styled for specialty clients such as Outlook and Internet Explorer while using a mobile-first design concept. I am currently accepting job offers for both remote and on-site work. I am a quick learner and very motivated to absorb as much as I can. I love to code and I am always excited to work on new projects. Whenever I'm not coding, you can find me mountain biking, whitewater kayaking, and baking. Shoot me an email and let's get your project started!",
