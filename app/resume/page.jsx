    "Nice to meet you!  My name is Kevin Parker. I am a front-end web designer specializing in React, NodeJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My main focus is landing pages and apps, but I also have plenty of experience in HTMl emails. I have also styled for specialty clients such as Outlook and Internet Explorer while using a mobile-first design concept. I am currently accepting job offers for both remote and on-site work. I am a quick learner and very motivated to absorb as much as I can. I love to code and I am always excited to work on new projects. Whenever I'm not coding, you can find me mountain biking, whitewater kayaking, and baking. Shoot me an email and let's get your project started!",

    "Despite not having formal programming employment, I have dedicated significant time to developing several projects, showcasing my coding skills. Alongside programming, I have maintained various part-time jobs, in order to survive until I break into the programming field. My typical weekly schedule involves working four days at part-time jobs and devoting three full days to programming. This self-driven approach has not only enhanced my technical abilities but also instilled a strong work ethic and time management skills. This unique blend of real-world work experience and self-taught programming expertise makes me a versatile and committed candidate.",

    "I took the traditional route from high school to college, initially unsure about my career path. I majored in Human Development with the goal of becoming an Occupational Therapist and also pursued a double minor in Philosophy and Creative Writing Poetry, even managing to get 3 poems published! However, post-college, I realized that path wasn't for me. I stumbled upon programming and was instantly hooked by the creativity it offered â€” something I hadn't expected. It's a field that blends analytical skills with creative flair, making it a very appealing career choice.",
